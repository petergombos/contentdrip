# Welcome to The Art of Doing Absolutely Nothing

You're here. You subscribed. And in doing so, you've already demonstrated the most important skill this course will teach you: the ability to commit to something without overthinking it.

## Why this course exists

The world is full of courses that teach you to do *more*. More productivity. More hustle. More 5am cold plunges followed by gratitude journaling followed by inbox zero followed by a spiritual collapse at 2pm.

This is not one of those courses.

This is a course about the radical, countercultural act of **doing less**. On purpose. Without guilt. While possibly horizontal.

## The curriculum

Here's what we'll cover over the next three days:

### Day 1: The Couch Curriculum

We'll explore why sitting down is one of humanity's greatest inventions and how to elevate your sitting practice from casual to transcendent. You'll learn the three levels of sitting and discover which level you naturally gravitate toward (spoiler: you're probably better at this than you think).

### Day 2: The Guilt-Free Nap

Napping gets a bad rap. We'll look at why that's ridiculous, review the four major nap varieties, and tackle the guilt problem head-on. By the end, you'll be napping with the confidence of a cat in a sunbeam.

### Day 3: Mastering the Blank Stare

The final frontier. Staring at nothing is the black belt of doing nothing, and we'll walk you through (slowly, obviously) how to achieve it. This is where everything comes together.

## How this works

- You'll get **one short email per day** for the next 3 days
- Each email has a **companion page** (like this one) with extended content for when you feel like going deeper — which, given the theme, you might not, and that's fine
- There are no quizzes, no deadlines, and absolutely no certificates (unless you print one yourself, in which case, that sounds like a lot of effort)

## A brief history of doing nothing

Doing nothing has a long and distinguished history:

- **Ancient Greece:** Philosophers spent entire days just *thinking* in the agora. Socrates was basically a professional loiterer.
- **The Renaissance:** Leonardo da Vinci was famously slow to finish things. The Mona Lisa took 16 years. The man understood pacing.
- **The Industrial Revolution:** Everything went wrong. People started measuring value by output, and we've been exhausted ever since.
- **Now:** You're here, reclaiming what the ancients knew — that sometimes the best thing to do is nothing at all.

## Your pre-course prep

Before tomorrow's first lesson, we have one small request:

**Identify your favorite doing-nothing spot.** It could be a couch, a hammock, a specific patch of floor, or that one chair in your house that nobody else is allowed to sit in. This will be your base of operations for the next three days.

That's it. No workbooks. No supplies. You already have everything you need: a body, a surface to put it on, and the willingness to not do anything with either of them.

See you tomorrow.
