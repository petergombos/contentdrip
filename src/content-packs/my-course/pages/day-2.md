# Day 2: The Guilt-Free Nap

Today we tackle humanity's most underrated activity: the nap. If yesterday was about sitting, today is about taking sitting to its logical conclusion — lying down and closing your eyes.

## The case for napping

Let's start with the facts. Napping is not a sign of weakness. It's practiced by:

- **Cats** — The most successful predators in any household. They nap 12–16 hours a day and show zero remorse.
- **Babies** — They nap constantly and everyone thinks they're adorable for it.
- **Winston Churchill** — Ran a country during a world war. Napped every afternoon. His exact words: "Nature has not intended mankind to work from eight in the morning until midnight without that refreshment of blessed oblivion which, even if it only lasts twenty minutes, is sufficient to renew all the vital forces."
- **Salvador Dalí** — Napped holding a key over a plate. When the key dropped and clanged, he'd wake up with surrealist ideas. Weird? Yes. Effective? Also yes.

If it's good enough for a cat, a baby, a prime minister, and a surrealist, it's good enough for you.

## The nap spectrum (expanded)

In the email, we gave you the overview. Here's the full breakdown.

### The Power Nap (15–20 minutes)

The espresso shot of naps. You close your eyes, drift lightly, and wake up feeling like a phone that just went from 15% to 60% battery. It won't get you to 100%, but it'll keep you running until bedtime.

**Best for:** Afternoon slumps, pre-meeting recovery, pretending you're "just resting your eyes" during a long video call.

**Risks:** Feeling slightly smug afterward. May develop a superiority complex over non-nappers.

### The Accidental Nap (30–45 minutes)

You didn't plan this. You sat down, maybe put on a documentary about penguins, and the next thing you know it's 45 minutes later and the penguins have migrated. This nap finds *you*.

**Best for:** Weekends, sick days, any situation involving a couch and a nature documentary.

**Risks:** Waking up confused about the time of day. Possible drool. The documentary has moved on without you and you'll never know if the penguins made it.

### The Sunday Special (1–2 hours)

The full-length feature film of naps. This is a commitment. You get under a blanket, you close the blinds, and you enter a different dimension. When you wake up, the light outside has changed and you're not entirely sure what day it is.

**Best for:** Recovery from a busy week. Rainy afternoons. Sundays (obviously).

**Risks:** Mild existential confusion upon waking. Time feels like a suggestion rather than a fact. You might wake up with sheet marks on your face that you'll wear to dinner.

### The "Just Resting My Eyes" (Duration: Unknown)

The stealth nap. You are not sleeping. You are absolutely not sleeping. You are merely closing your eyes for a moment to think more clearly. The fact that your breathing has become rhythmic and there's a small whistling sound is coincidental.

**Best for:** Plausible deniability in any situation.

**Risks:** Everyone knows you were sleeping. You know everyone knows. There's an unspoken agreement to never mention it.

## How to nap without guilt: a step-by-step protocol

### Step 1: Reframe the nap

You are not "being lazy." You are engaging in **active recovery**. Athletes do it. CEOs do it. NASA studied it and found that a 26-minute nap improved pilot performance by 34%. You're basically a pilot now.

### Step 2: Choose your nap environment

The ideal nap environment has:
- **Darkness** — or at least dimness. An eye mask works if you want to feel fancy.
- **A horizontal surface** — couch, bed, floor, or hammock. No judgment.
- **Quiet** — or consistent background noise. A fan is great. Construction outside your window is not.
- **A blanket** — this is non-negotiable. Even if it's warm. The blanket is psychological.

### Step 3: Set boundaries

Tell your brain (and anyone who might interrupt you) that this nap has a beginning and an end. A timer helps. So does a closed door. So does the blank, unyielding stare of someone who will not be disturbed.

### Step 4: Let go

Don't try to fall asleep. That's like trying to be funny — the harder you try, the worse it gets. Just lie there. Close your eyes. If sleep comes, great. If it doesn't and you just rest for 20 minutes, that's also great. The bar is on the floor, and that's exactly where it should be.

## Famous naps throughout history

- **Albert Einstein** reportedly napped in his armchair holding a pencil. When the pencil dropped, it woke him up. He'd then jot down whatever was in his head. The man literally dreamed up physics.
- **Leonardo da Vinci** practiced polyphasic sleep — napping for 20 minutes every 4 hours instead of sleeping at night. He also painted the Mona Lisa, so maybe he was onto something. (Do not try this at home.)
- **John F. Kennedy** napped after lunch every single day while president. If the leader of the free world can take a 1pm nap, so can you.

## Today's exercise

Take a nap. Any variety from the spectrum above. Here's how:

1. Find a comfortable spot
2. Set a timer if you want (20 minutes is a great starting point)
3. Lie down and close your eyes
4. Don't check your phone. Your phone is fine. It doesn't miss you.
5. When the timer goes off (or when you wake up naturally), take 60 seconds to just lie there before getting up

That's it. No journaling. No reflection questions. Just a nap.

Tomorrow is our final lesson: **Mastering the Blank Stare**. It's the boss fight of doing nothing, and you're ready.
