You have your topic. You have your curriculum. Now let's write the first email. This sample lesson shows the anatomy of a good course email.

## Subject lines

Your subject line is the only thing standing between your email and the archive folder. The formula that works best for courses:

**[Day X]: [Specific promise]**

- "Day 1: The three-sentence pitch that gets replies"
- "Day 2: Why your landing page isn't converting (and the fix)"

Specific beats clever. Curiosity beats clever.

## The anatomy of a great course email

**1. The hook (first 2 lines)**
Start with a problem, a surprising fact, or a direct statement — not a greeting.

**2. The lesson (100–250 words)**
One idea. One email. If you find yourself writing a second concept, save it for the next lesson.

**3. The action (1 clear next step)**
Every email should end with something to do. Small actions compound.

**4. The tease**
End with what's coming next. Give subscribers a reason to look forward to tomorrow.

## Sample exercise

Draft your welcome email using this structure:
- Hook: What problem does your course solve?
- What they'll get: 3–4 specific outcomes
- First action: Small, doable today
- Tease: What's coming in Day 1?
