Good morning. Or afternoon. Or whenever you're reading this — time is a construct and we don't judge.

## Let's talk about naps

The nap is nature's Ctrl+Z. Feeling overwhelmed? Nap. Made a bad decision? Nap. Can't figure out what to have for dinner? Nap first, decide later.

Yet somehow, napping has a reputation problem. People treat it like it's *giving up* when it's actually a tactical retreat.

## The nap spectrum

Here's a handy guide to the different nap varieties:

| Nap Type | Duration | Side Effects |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| The Power Nap | 15–20 min | Mild smugness, renewed energy |
| The Accidental | 45 min | Confusion about what year it is |
| The Sunday Special | 2+ hours | Existential clarity, possible time travel |
| The "Just Resting My Eyes" | Unknown | Denial, drool marks on pillow |

> "I love sleep. My life has the tendency to fall apart when I'm awake, you know?"
> — Ernest Hemingway (probably napping when he wrote this)

## The guilt problem

Here's the thing about nap guilt: it's entirely made up. Nobody on their deathbed has ever said, "I wish I'd napped less." Your body literally *wants* to nap — it's not a bug, it's a feature.

## Today's exercise

Take a nap today. Set a timer for 20 minutes if you want to be responsible about it. Or don't set a timer and see what happens. We believe in you either way.
