You did it. You subscribed to an email course about doing nothing.

That might be the most productive thing you do all week — and ironically, it's the last productive thing we'll ask of you.

## What to expect

Over the next 3 days, you'll receive one short email per day. Each one covers a core principle of strategic inactivity:

1. **Day 1** — The Couch Curriculum (why sitting is an underrated life skill)
2. **Day 2** — The Guilt-Free Nap (science says you should lie down right now)
3. **Day 3** — The Grand Finale: Mastering the Blank Stare

## Your first assignment

Do nothing for 30 seconds. Seriously. Just sit there. Don't check another tab. Don't scroll. Just... exist.

Done? Great. You're a natural.

See you tomorrow (or whenever — we're not your boss).
