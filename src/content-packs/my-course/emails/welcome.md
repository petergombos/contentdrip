> **Demo content** — This is a sample lesson from the ContentDrip starter template. Replace all emails in `src/content-packs/my-course/emails/` with your own.

You just signed up for a demo email course *about* email courses. The content below is placeholder text to show you what a real course email looks like.

Over the next 3 sample lessons, you'll see examples of how to structure drip-fed content: a topic that fits, a curriculum that flows, and emails people will actually finish reading.

## What a subscriber would get by Day 3

- A validated course topic
- A 3–5 email curriculum mapped out, lesson by lesson
- Their first email written and ready to send
- A simple plan for getting their first subscribers

## Why the email course format works

Most online courses have a 3–15% completion rate. Email courses routinely hit 40–60%. The reason: the inbox is where people actually pay attention. No logins, no forgotten bookmarks — you show up for them on a schedule they chose.

That's what ContentDrip makes possible. You write the course once. It delivers itself, on repeat, to everyone who signs up.

## Sample action step

Before the next lesson, write down 3 things you know well enough to teach in 3–5 emails. They don't have to be earth-shattering — narrow, specific, and immediately useful is best.
