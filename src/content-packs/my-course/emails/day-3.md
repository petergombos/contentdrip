## The ancient art of staring at nothing

You know that moment when someone catches you staring into space and asks, "What are you thinking about?" and you say "Nothing" and *you actually mean it*?

That's not a failure of thought. That's a **achievement**.

Most people's brains run like a browser with 47 tabs open. The blank stare is the equivalent of closing all of them — yes, even the one playing music.

## The technique

Here's how to achieve a proper blank stare:

1. **Find a spot** — a wall, a window, a patch of ceiling. Nothing too interesting.
2. **Let your eyes relax** — you're not *looking* at something, you're looking at *nothing*.
3. **When a thought appears**, don't chase it. Let it walk through your brain like a stranger passing on the street.
4. **Maintain** — the goal is at least 60 seconds of pure, uninterrupted blankness.

If you feel your phone calling to you, remember: your phone doesn't have feelings. It will be fine.
