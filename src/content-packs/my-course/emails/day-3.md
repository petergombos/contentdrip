> **Demo content** — This is the final sample lesson. Replace it with your own in `src/content-packs/my-course/emails/day-3.md`.

You've done the hard part. You have a topic, a curriculum, and at least a draft of your emails. Today we ship it — or at least, that's what this placeholder lesson pretends.

## Your landing page

Your landing page needs to answer one question: _What will I be able to do after taking this course?_

Your headline should be the outcome — not the name of the course.

- "Write a cold email you'd actually reply to — in 3 lessons"
- "Survive your first month with a rescue dog. One email a day for 5 days."

ContentDrip's subscribe form handles signup, confirmation, and delivery scheduling automatically.

## Where to find subscribers

**Existing audience first.** Post about it once — Twitter/X, LinkedIn, a newsletter, a Slack community you're part of.

**Niche communities second.** Find 2–3 online communities where your audience hangs out.

**Referrals third.** Add a line to your final email: "If this helped you, forward it to someone who'd find it useful."

## That's the demo course

This was a sample 4-email course to show you the ContentDrip format. Here's what to do next:

1. Edit the markdown files in `src/content-packs/my-course/emails/`
2. Update the pack config in `src/content-packs/my-course/pack.ts`
3. Customize the email shell in `src/content-packs/my-course/email-shell.tsx`
4. Replace the homepage content in `src/app/page.tsx`
