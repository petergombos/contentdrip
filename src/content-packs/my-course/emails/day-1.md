## The problem with standing

Somewhere along the way, society decided that being upright was a sign of ambition. But consider this: every great idea in history was probably *thought of* while sitting down.

Newton? Sitting under a tree. Einstein? Riding a bus (seated, obviously). Your greatest shower thought? You were basically standing in a warm rain doing nothing.

## The three levels of sitting

Not all sitting is created equal. Here's the official taxonomy:

**Level 1 — Active Sitting.** You're at a desk. Your posture is okay. You're technically sitting, but you're doing *work*. This barely counts.

**Level 2 — Passive Sitting.** You're on the couch. There might be a blanket. You have no agenda. This is good.

**Level 3 — Transcendent Sitting.** You've been on the couch so long that you've become part of it. The cushions have molded to your exact shape. Your phone is in another room, and you don't care. *This is the goal.*

## Today's exercise

Find your favorite sitting spot. Sit in it for 10 minutes without reaching for a device. If a thought comes to you like "I should be doing something," simply acknowledge it and let it float away like a cloud shaped like your to-do list.
