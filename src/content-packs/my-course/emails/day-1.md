The most common reason people never launch their email course: they can't decide what it should be about. This sample lesson demonstrates how to structure a teaching email.

## The one-sentence test

A great email course topic passes this test:

> "This course helps **[specific person]** do **[specific thing]** in **[timeframe or format]**."

For example:
- "This course helps freelance designers write better proposals in 5 emails."
- "This course helps new dog owners survive the first 30 days in one week of emails."

Notice what these have in common: **a narrow audience, a concrete outcome, a contained scope.**

## The curriculum skeleton

Email courses work best when each lesson has a clear job:

1. **Welcome** — Why this topic matters, what's coming, and the first small action
2. **Day 1** — The foundational concept
3. **Day 2** — The first skill or technique
4. **Day 3** — The advanced move or launch step

You can go up to 7 lessons, but 4–5 is the sweet spot.

## Sample exercise

Open a doc and write:
1. Your one-sentence course description
2. Your 4–5 lesson titles — just the subject lines
