Over the next five days, you'll receive one short, actionable lesson each morning. Each lesson takes about 5 minutes to read and includes a practical exercise you can apply immediately.

## Your 5-Day Journey

- **Day 1: The Power of Single-Tasking** — Learn why doing less leads to achieving more
- **Day 2: Designing Your Ideal Morning** — Create a morning routine that sets you up for success
- **Day 3: The Two-Minute Rule** — Build unstoppable momentum with tiny actions
- **Day 4: Digital Minimalism** — Reclaim your attention from constant distractions
- **Day 5: Building Sustainable Habits** — Turn these insights into a lasting daily practice

## Before We Begin

Tonight, set out one single task for tomorrow morning. Not three. Not five. Just one.

Write it down and place it where you'll see it first thing. This small act of preparation is the foundation of everything we'll explore this week.

See you tomorrow morning!
