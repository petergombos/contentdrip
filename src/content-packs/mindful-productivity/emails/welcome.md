Over the next five days, you'll receive one short, actionable lesson each morning. Each lesson takes about 5 minutes to read and includes a practical exercise you can apply immediately.

## What to Expect

- **Day 1:** The Power of Single-Tasking — why less is more
- **Day 2:** Designing Your Ideal Morning — start strong every day
- **Day 3:** The Two-Minute Rule — build unstoppable momentum
- **Day 4:** Digital Minimalism — reclaim your attention
- **Day 5:** Building Sustainable Habits — make it last

## A Quick Tip Before We Begin

Tonight, set out one single task for tomorrow morning. Not three. Not five. Just one. Write it down and place it where you'll see it first thing.

This small act of preparation is the foundation of everything we'll explore this week.

See you tomorrow morning!
